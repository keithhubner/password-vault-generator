## ✨ What This Tool Does

- 🏢 **Generate test vaults** with realistic business data
- 🔑 **Create weak passwords** for security testing
- 📊 **Export multiple formats** (JSON, CSV, XML)
- 🏗️ **Nested folders/collections** for complex organizational structures
- ⚡ **Handle large datasets** (up to 10,000 items) with progress tracking

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites
You need **Node.js 18 or newer** installed on your computer.

**Check if you have Node.js:**
```bash
node --version
```

**Don't have Node.js?** Download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)

### 2. Get the Code
```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/keithhubner/password-vault-generator.git

# Go into the project folder
cd password-vault-generator
```

### 3. Install & Run
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the application
npm run dev
```

### 4. Open Your Browser
Go to **http://localhost:3000** and start generating vault data!

## 📋 How to Use

### Basic Usage
1. **Choose your vault format** (Bitwarden, LastPass, etc.)
2. **Set item counts** (logins, notes, cards, identities)
3. **Click "Generate Vault"**
4. **Download** your test data

### Advanced Features
- **Weak Passwords**: Enable for security testing (configurable percentage)
- **Password Reuse**: Simulate real-world password habits
- **Real URLs**: Use actual website domains vs. fake ones
- **Nested Collections**: Create hierarchical folder structures
- **Large Datasets**: Generate thousands of items with progress tracking

## 💡 Use Cases

### For Developers
- **API Testing**: Generate realistic data for password manager integrations
- **Database Seeding**: Populate test environments with structured vault data
- **UI/UX Testing**: Test how your app handles large datasets and various formats

### For Security Teams
- **Password Audits**: Generate datasets with known weak passwords for testing detection tools
- **Penetration Testing**: Create realistic vaults to test security scanning tools
- **Compliance Testing**: Validate how systems handle different vault structures

### For DevOps
- **Migration Testing**: Test data migration between different password managers
- **Backup Testing**: Validate backup and restore procedures with realistic data
- **Performance Testing**: Stress test systems with large vault datasets

## 🎯 Supported Export Formats

| Password Manager | Export Format | Features |
|-----------------|---------------|----------|
| **Bitwarden** | JSON | Individual/Organization vaults, nested collections, TOTP |
| **LastPass** | CSV | Simple format, groupings, TOTP secrets |
| **Keeper** | JSON/CSV | Nested folders, shared folders, custom fields |
| **Microsoft Edge** | CSV | Basic password export format |
| **KeePassX** | CSV | Simple database export |
| **KeePass2** | XML | Full database with groups, entries, metadata |

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

### Security Testing
- **Weak Password %**: Set percentage of passwords that are weak/common
- **Password Reuse %**: Simulate users reusing passwords across sites
- **Real URLs**: Use actual domains (google.com, facebook.com) vs fake ones

### Data Volume
- **Login Items**: 0-10,000 password entries
- **Secure Notes**: Text notes with metadata
- **Credit Cards**: Payment card information
- **Identity Items**: Personal information (name, address, etc.)

### Organization Structure
- **Nested Collections**: Create folder hierarchies (Finance/Accounting/Invoices)
- **Business Departments**: Use realistic department names
- **Collection Distribution**: Automatically assign items to collections

## 📝 Step-by-Step Examples

### Example 1: Basic Bitwarden Export
**Goal**: Create a simple Bitwarden vault for testing
```
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Select "Bitwarden" as vault format
3. Keep "Individual" vault type selected
4. Set "Number of Logins" to 50
5. Click "Generate Vault" 
6. Click "Download JSON"
```
**Result**: You'll get a JSON file with 50 realistic login entries

### Example 2: Security Testing Dataset
**Goal**: Test your password manager's security scanning
```
1. Select any vault format
2. Check "Include weak passwords" 
3. Set weak password percentage to 40%
4. Check "Reuse passwords across multiple sites"
5. Set password reuse to 30%
6. Generate 200+ login items
7. Import into your password manager
8. Run security audit to see weak/reused passwords detected
```

### Example 3: Large Organization Vault
**Goal**: Test how your system handles enterprise data
```
1. Select "Bitwarden" format
2. Choose "Organization" vault type  
3. Check "Create collections for business departments"
4. Check "Use nested collections"
5. Set total collections to 50
6. Set logins to 1000, notes to 100, cards to 50
7. Check "Assign items to collections"
8. Generate and download
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**❌ "next: command not found"**
```bash
# Delete node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run dev
```

**❌ Port 3000 already in use**
```bash
# Use a different port
npm run dev -- -p 3001
```

**❌ Out of memory errors with large datasets**
- Try generating smaller batches (< 5000 items)
- Close other applications to free memory
- Use the progress indicator to monitor generation
